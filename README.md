The goals of this piece of code will be to:

1.  Manage RSS feeds that contain mp3s for listening.
2.  Parse the feed, and move the mp3 to a staging area.
3.  For those mp3s that are not tagged correctly, tag as closely as possible to the content as can be achieved.
4.  Make sure there are no duplicate downloads, and clear out the staging directory as needed.
5.  Whatever else I might think of in coding.
