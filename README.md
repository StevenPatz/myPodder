The goals:

1.  Manage RSS feeds that contain mp3s for listening.
2.  Parse the feed, and move the mp3 to a staging area.
3.  For those mp3s that are not tagged correctly, tag as closely as possible to the content as can be achieved.
4.  Make sure there are no duplicate downloads, and clear out the staging directory as needed.
5.  Whatever else.

Notes on progress.

So I can get a file downloaded and saved to the proper directory.  Next up is to set up database 
entries so that I know a file has been downloaded.  Also next up, a display of files that have
not been downloaded.  This list should update as files are downloaded.

Trying to keep this as focused on just the podcast side of things for now.  But it seems
that I could just also roll into this a feed reader interface as well.
